# Codecheck notes

## Execution and environment

The workflow in the directory `code/` was tested with Python 3.7 in a virtual environment created with `mkvirtualenv --python $(which python3) <env-name>`.
It can be executed with

```
(<env-name>) Hopfield-1982$ pip install -r codecheck/requirements.txt
(<env-name>) Hopfield-1982$ python code/Hopfield-1982.py
```
